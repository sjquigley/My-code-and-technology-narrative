  <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>My love of computers started when I began playing around with Adobe Photoshop and InDesign while working on my high school newspaper (InDesign was called Pagemaker way back then). I got pretty good "photoshoping" the head of our school principal onto bikini clad models and  designing logos and advertisements for my friends. I loved the Adobe design graphic interface and the way I could learn new Adobe tools really quickly. In grad school I discovered Adobe Muse, a program that allowed me to design and publish webpages using the same kind of graphic interface. I started designing place-based mobile apps with my students and in my own creative work. I used Adobe Muse regularly for four years until one day Adobe announced they were discontinuing the tool. It was a dark day for me, but looking back, an important one in that it forced me to look for new tools I could use in my teaching. Eventually, that journey led to “basic coding,” that is, pedagogies and tools designed to give students a basic understanding of code and computer science and the skills to continue their own learning.</p>

<!--Conduct your own Dear Data inquiry…collecting, analyzing, and communicating data (Shout out to Dear Data authors Georgia Lupi and Stefanie Posavec). Use your built-in screen time monitoring features on your phone, tablet, and computer to assist you in tracking your technology use over 5-7 days. Then create a data visualization using colored pencils, crayons, or markers that tells the story of you and your data. Here's our framing question “How do you interact with technology and in what ways? (frequency and distribution of various activities.) For example: What apps get you through your day, what kinds of media are you consuming, what kinds of websites are you using?-->
<div class="text-block" style="text-align: left">
  <h2><i>Dear Data</i>: Everyday Code</h2>
    <p>I collected five-days worth of data tracking my use of computers. My data say that, excluding my sleeping hours, I interact with technology for all but a few hours a day. However, the data needs some qualification, as most of my mobile phone usage involves Libby, my public library app. I spend at least two hours a day listening to audio books on Libby. Right now I am listening to <i>Crime and Punishment</i>. During the work week I spend most of my day writing on Microsoft Word or researching on Google Scholar. At night, I spend an hour or so watching Netflix or YouTube. Right now I am watching the final season of <i>The Crown.</i> On the weekends I am pretty good at shutting off work, but my mobile phone usage goes way up, especially my use of Libby and Podcasts. I also use technology to connect with others…I spend around 3 hours messaging a week and two hours on Facebook. I would love to think my time on Facebook is positive, but lately I find myself getting trapped watching Reels or somehow ending up on Instagram.</p>

<div class="text-block" style="text-align: left">
  <h2>Code and digital technology in the ELA classroom</h2>
    <p>When I first started teaching, I used a mimeograph machine to run copies. We’d fit the sheet we wanted to copy between wax sheets, then lock it onto the drum roller, make sure the machine had fluid, and turn it on…watch your fingers as the intoxicating purple sheets thumped out one at a time. Over my career in teaching, I must have killed dozens of trees. Today everything in my classroom is digital, and I love it. I especially love teaching writing using Google Docs. In the old days I’d leave handwritten feedback for students and watch them in turn, throw their papers straight in the trash bin. With Google Docs it's easier to work with students on revisions, and I can look through version control to see students improving their writing. Lately, teaching writing has brought some challenges, especially in terms of addressing Chat GPT. Rather than focusing on the death of teaching writing, I am trying to learn and grow with this new technology, working to discover how AI might enhance what we do as writing teachers, helping students learn the essence of “good writing.”   </p>
